                        In the HAW.sk file:
                        You will see different options!
                        It is recommended that you leave words such as "maxlimit" or "MessageThirstyPlayer" untouched. 
                        You can change the following colon of the options give. If you have an error contact "ImCardiaK#9564" on Discord !
                        
                        
                        "maxlimit" is the hydration limit. When the player's hydration is equal to this one, then the player is completely hydrated.
                        
                        "NumberAddAfterYouDrinkWater" This is the number that is awarded when the player drinks water. This will be added to achieve 
                        total hydration or otherwise say "maxlimit"
                        
                        
                        "TimeBeforeThePlayerGetsAReductionInHydration"
                        it's up to you to allocate the time it takes before the player experiences a reduction in hydration! 
                        it is linked with the "Time" option!
                        "Time" It is linked with "TimeBeforeThePlayerGetsAReductionInHydration" 
                        the "Time" option allows you to know if the value of the above option is calculated in 'Minutes' 'Hours' or 'seconds'
                        
                        
                        "MessageThirstyPlayer" this is the message that will be sent when the player has reached their minimum hydration level! 
                        this one must drink immediately or it will take damage!
                        
                        "MessageWhenThePlayerComesDrinkingWater" this is the message that is sent when a player drinks water .. quite simply.
